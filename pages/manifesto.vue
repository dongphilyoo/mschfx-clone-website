          The goal of collaboration is to create a sum greater than the whole of
          its parts: brands collaborate out of a utilitarian urge to pool their
          collective audience reach. Luxury brands want to downmarket their
          brand (without diluting it) and so collaborate with sportswear
          companies; streetwear brands want the approval of fashion even as they
          position themselves outside its norms and so they collaborate with
          high end designers. This is extremely effective.

          For the purposes of this discussion we will define “collaboration”
          broadly, and include all production relationships in which two (or
          more) brands are recognizable by a consumer at the point of retail.
          The utility of a given collaboration is determined by the relative
          cultural status of the participants, and whether the collaboration is
          consensual.

          The ubiquity of collaborative paradigms gradually moves us away from a
          world in which they matter. Meaningful brand collaborations rely on
          each component part being distinct, and the combinative result
          therefore a surprise, a study in contrasts, or pairing of
          complementary flavors. When collaboration becomes the rule of an
          industry, rather than the exception - when brands cross over like the
          fumbling, arbitrary results of sex dice - they serve to smooth the
          entire retail landscape into an even gradient.

          Nowhere is this more evident than in streetwear, the underground,
          outcast, rebellious power users of print on demand t-shirt services,
          each desperate to differentiate even as they are beholden to
          lowest-common-denominator production practices.

          chain of agreements goes circular. This ouroboros of usage rights
          ultimately boils down to one de facto conclusion: streetwear is,

          interchangeable parts.

        <p>
          We term this the Collaborative Continuum: a distribution of brands and
          audiences no longer discrete but continually linked through a mesh of
          crossovers, blending seamlessly into one another through their history
          of retail association. When you buy one, odds are good you’re getting
          another on the side; not two brands, but one selected manifestation of
          a single entity.

          MSCHF X flattens the curation and purchase of two hands worth of
          individual brands into a single shirt. Simultaneously, through some
          applied hacksmanship, we remove these pieces from their pedestals -
          none have unique worth beyond the simple associative value of their
          logos.

          What remains, when these decontextualized signifiers are stitched back
          into a pastiche canvas, is the platonic ideal of 2020 streetwear in
